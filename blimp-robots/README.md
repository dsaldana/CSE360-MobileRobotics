This code is part of the course: CSE498: Reinforcement Learning In Robotics 2023

* The file ``bicopter.ttt``includes the simulation in coppeliaSim.
  * Instructions to run the remoteAPI in coppeliaSim are in intro_coppelia.ipynb
* The file ``bicopter_control.py`` includes the necessary methods to control the vehicle






### Setup CoppeliaSim: Python interface (2023)

Make sure you have following files in your directory, in order to run the various examples:

1. ```sim.py``` and ```simConst.py``` in coppelia's folder ```programming/legacyRemoteApi/remoteApiBindings/python/python/```
2. the appropriate remote API library: ```remoteApi.dll``` (Windows), ```remoteApi.dylib``` (Mac) or ```remoteApi.so``` (Linux). In coppelia's folder ```programming/legacyRemoteApi/remoteApiBindings/lib/lib/[YOUR OS]/```
